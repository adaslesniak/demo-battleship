# demo-battleship

It's just a demo, to play with C#. 
It's not finished (missing implementation of unit tests) so it's not production ready, but works.
It's missing clear interfaces, but it's agains YAGNI philosophy to determine what (and how) parts are to be
made replecable, extractable into separate modules/services before future of an app is determinable.
